      <h2>
        You all know rickrolling to be some kind of annoying prank where someone
        sends you a video of "Never gonna give you up" by Rick Astley in an
        unexpected way, with them being silently snickering with an evil grin
        while you cringe at the video/audio/lyrics/whatever.
      </h2>
      <p>That needs no explanation.</p>
      <h3>
        So without further ado please forgive me (or not) while I show you a
        hopefully creative way of rickrolling that you can use to annoy the heck
        out of your friends while potentially impressing them at the same time.
        (while also trying to rickroll you as much times as I possibly can.
        Gotta get my dopamine hits from the rickrolling in. You have been
        warned.)

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        So why bother with this? Why make a super technical fancy way of
        rickrolling when you can... you know... shove a link to the music video.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Like this</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
        >please click this link. PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU</a
      >
      <p>
        or even better, shove the rickroll into your face with this cool embed
      </p>
      <iframe

      <h4>gottem</h4>
      <p>
        As you can see these types of rickrolls happen very often. Assuming you
        dont live under a rock you would probably be very annoyed and cautious
        of links *innocuously* sent in conversations
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So lets change it up a bit. Bring in some new reactions of a mixture of
        awe, more intense annoyance, and the thought of "WHAT THE HECK BRO SPENT
        2 HOURS (or so) ON THIS FANCY ASS METHOD TO RICKROLL ME
        WHYYYYYYYYYY!!@#!@$!@#@$@#"
      </p>
      <h1>sneaky sneaky</h1>
      <p>
        When someone visits a webpage most of the attention is diverted to the
        content of the page, 90% (roughly) of the screen. Which is fair enough,
        it is shoved in our faces most of the time. There is a very small chance
        that we pay any meaningful attention to the top part of the web browser,
        where all the tabs are displayed. After all we only look at it when we
        are about to switch tabs. And even so, if you have a trillion tabs open
        like I do, you tend to look at the icons of the images instead of the
        actual page title.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/3.png"
      />
      <p>
        This makes putting a potential rickroll at the page title a very very
        sneaky way to rickroll someone. Think about it, they could be browsing
        the page, for a long time, not even realizing they are being rickrolled.
        And when they change the tab they are going to see the song and facepalm
        in frustration.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/4.png"
      />
      <br />
      <h1>html title</h1>
      <p>
        In order to set the title of the page, there is a very convenient <
        title > element in html. If you are a computer nerd that enjoys looking
        at the "behind the scenes" of a website you will see the title of the
        page that looks somewhat like this:
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/5.png"
      />
      <p>
        So wouldn't it be interesting if we just manipulated it in a way. Say
        wouldnt it be interesting to have all the lyrics displayed on the title?
        (obviously can't put a video though I wish I could)
      </p>
      <h1>the javascript</h1>
      <p>
        Javascript is the language that makes websites interactive. So let's get
        out there and change the title through that.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/6.png"
      />
      <h2>the list</h2>
      <p>
        First we gotta put the lyrics in the code. This is self explanatory,
        otherwise how would the browser know what to display on the title? By
        putting the lyrics in an javascript array, we can loop through the
        lyrics and display each line of the lyrics onto the title.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/7.png"
      />
      <p>well hopefully you looked at the list and got rickrolled :)</p>
      <h2>the interval</h2>
      <p>
        If we were do to a normal while loop through the list and changed the
        title to every line of the lyrics it would go so fast we wouldn't be
        able to effectively read the lyrics as it would be going way too fast.
        Computers are super fast at running through loops and processing data in
        general, which is how they are so good at calculations. Which is why we
        need to let the computer know that it should /slow down/. It needs to
        wait for us to read the title fully before displaying the next set of
        the lyrics. In other words, it should bend down and smell the
        metaphorical flowers, and take a chill pill.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/8.png"
      />
      <p>
        Here we are setting the computer up to run the function to change the
        title (more on that later) every 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second. That
        should be long enough for you to read one line of the lyrics. If not, it
        will likely confuse you, causing you to look at the title changes more,
        only to be slapped with the sinking realisation that you just got
        rickrolled.
      </p>
      <h2>the function</h2>
      <p>
        We set the document title programatically through document.title ,
        setting it to be the first element of my rickrolling lyrics list.
        Starting from 0, the 0th element if you will, as for some odd reason the
        computer counts from 0 instead of 1 (i mean you can count from any
        number but like in hide and seek do you really go "alright in -1.5,
        -1.4, -1.3... ready set go here i come"?)
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/9.png"
      />
      <p>
        Every second we increase the index of the list by 1, so we move to
        showing the next line of the lyrics.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/10.png"
      />
      <p>
        And once we reach the end of the list (the 54th element i think) we go
        back to the beginning and we rickroll them once again.
      </p>
      <h1>the final result</h1>
      <h2>look up to the title at the top of the page..... i dare you ðŸ˜ˆ</h2>
      <p>And <b>Don't tell me you're too blind to see</b> it</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Rickroll "Extreme Version"</h1>
      <p>
        Ok so this rickroll is extremely effective... if you own the website.
        This requires you to be able to edit the code and add that little
        rickrolling script.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you don't own the website there's nothing you can do. It's not as
        if you can like open up the code and inject that script... right? Or is
        there another way?
      </p>
      <h1>Rickrolling through a browser extension</h1>
      <p>
        Browser extensions can do a lot of stuff. In fact there's a giant list
        of what features one could code into a browser extension.
      </p>
      <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api"
        >click here. I pinky promise this is not a rickroll.</a
      >
      <p>
        However a key feature of browser extensions is the ability to modify the
        appearance of web pages. Any web pages on your browser. You see where
        we're headed with this right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a browser extension that modifies the titles of every webpage in
        the window to display the rickroll lyrics. You could be innocently
        sharing your screen with a friend and direct your mouse to the top of
        the screen, leading for all the tabs to rickroll them in unison.
      </p>
      <p>Well my friend you won't have to imagine that anymore.</p>
      <h2>the folder with the manifesto</h2>
      <p>
        In order to make our own *custom* browser extension, we need to have a
        folder with all the files, and the file we must have is the manifest
        file -- manifest.json. (but i like to think of it as a manifesto e.g. a
        communist manifesto. dont ruin my moment).
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/11.png"
      />
      <p>
        The manifest document contains lots of information regarding the browser
        extensions, such as permissions, title, the author and injected scripts.
      </p>
      <h2>the content script</h2>
      <p>
        A content script modifies the content of every page when installed onto
        a browser extension. We can put our title modifying code into the
        content script.
        <img
          src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/rickroll1/12.png"
        />
      </p>
      <h2>uploading it</h2>
      <p>
        Lastly we upload the finished folder into the browser extension settings
        page, while making sure to enable developer mode (cuz we're nerds).
      </p>
      <h1>the result</h1>
      <p>
        Just look at this chaos. Every page is transformed into a rickrolling
        menace. You could innocently be sitting near a friend and subtly hover
        your mouse to the top of the screen, rickrolling anyone who dares look,
        just like how Medusa turned everyone who dared look to stone.
      </p>
      <video controls>

          type="video/mp4"
        />
      </video>
      <p>You can rest assured that the code will <b> never let you down</b></p>
      <p>It will <b>never give you up</b></p>
      <p>
        And as <b>A full commitment's what I'm thinking of</b>, there will be a
        part 2, so you can get rickrolled for another time.
