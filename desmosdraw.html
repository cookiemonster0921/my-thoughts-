        <h2>big flex time</h2>
        <p>let the flex bomb drop real quick - it is a bowser drawing in desmos</p>

      <h2>/real/ introduction</h2>
      <p>Art looks good, and as you all know making art is a biiiig flex üí™. However when I try to draw something I'm so messy or uncoordinated so that a 'sketch' of a person would end up so simple that I could graph it. <br> So I thought, what if I graph a drawing instead? *not draw a graph; feels like a fine line between them*. </p>
      <h2>increasing brain waves</h2>
      <p>Did you know that when you draw, you put your pencil on the paper and move your hand to another location? What if you do the same on a desmos graph and hope that a line appears? Well unfortunately the graph only moves. Boooring. <br> Well, with a few extra steps you can basically convert desmos to the drawing applications of your dreams ;)</p>
      <h2>step 1: POINTS CAN MOVE???? AINT NO WAY</h2>
      <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/2.png'>
      <p>If a point is defined with x and y as variables, you can somehow move the point to define a new x and y. Crazy, right?</p>
      <h2>step 2: defy the laws of high school graphing by making a shape without using x or y</h2>
      <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/3.png'>
      <p>no x, no y, this is why</p>
      <h2>step 3: lights, camera, action</h2>
      <p>There's this feature in desmos called actions that allow for on screen events to happen in response to a click, by activating it you can write cool features that feel more like code than math 0_0. such as:</p>
      <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/4.png'>
      <h2>step 4: defining some lists</h2>
      <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/5.png'>
      <p>these 2 lists- shown by symbols [] are the x and y points of where my point (a, b) is. You might be wondering why the a and b is in []. This is important later.</p>
      <h2>step 5: more definitions</h2>
        <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/12.png'>
        <p>When I click on my tiny little point here I'm gonna use desmos -special- function join() to join values of 2 lists. The x point defined from earlier is added to the x points list through this method to create a list full of x values my little dot has moved to. Same with y. As the x and y point from earlier was defined in a list e.g. [a] it ensures that it adds the value properly to the x points list, otherwise the result is weird. Join() only joins lists.</p>
     <h2>step 6: its polygon time</h2>
        <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/6.png'>
        <p>this defines x and y points lists of multiple numbers to form a polygon. Here's what we have so far:</p>
        <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/7.png'>
        <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/8.png'>
        <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/9.png'>
        <p>Repeat the process more times and you can get an extremely weird shaped polygon.</p>
    <h2>step 7: OMG WHY WONT THIS SEPARATE</h2>
        <p>You might soon find out that if you continue this the whole thing is just one big funky shape and is a mess like my handwriting. Not good. </p>
        <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/10.png'>
        <p>Introducing............... my 'new shape' function!!!<br> This bad boy, using similar concepts of joining lists adds the newly created polygon ('shape' list) into another list 'shapes'! It also resets the x points and y points lists so that you are free to define a new polygon while keeping the original intact. All you have to do is click new .')</p>
    <h2>step 8: draw em</h2>
        <p>By continually drawing a polygon, adding it into the list and drawing another one, you can get something vaguely resembling a drawing. Oh, and the function from step 3- it undoes all the drawings, leaving you to on a fresh cartesian plane to draw on üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è. You don't want to continually use the desmos undo button :(</p>
        <img src='https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/11.png'>
        <p>Also make sure to input an image to draw off on in desmos if needed. Just like an online stencil.</p>
    <h2>step 9: the final step</h2>
          <img src="https://cookiemonster0921.github.io/my-thoughts-/images/desmosdraw/1.png">
          <p>let the flex bomb drop real quick - it is a bowser drawing in desmos</p>
